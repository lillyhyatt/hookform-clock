{/* A page which displays the time by creating a new date in state and then:
Displaying it in the correct format for the user
Having a clock component that takes in that date and a locale and formats
 it to that locale
[BONUS POINTS} Make the clock tick. (So youâ€™ll need to use a timer. 
Think about when you can use a timer in a react component) */}
